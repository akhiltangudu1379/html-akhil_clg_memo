    <h1><i>My College Memories</i></h1>
    <h2>Navras</h2>
    <p>
      <p>
We had an event in college called Navras. It happened before the Navratri
vacation. We had to wear traditional attire, and I wore a white kurta with
blue jeans. I was practicing mathematics problems (Matrices and Calculus).
I was deeply focused and couldn’t concentrate on what was happening around me.
Meanwhile, a boy in our class brought a DSLR camera and started capturing photos.
He took a few photos of me while I was studying.

    <h2><i>Akki as a teacher</i></h2>
    <p>
I like teaching. One day, our PPS (Computer Science) ma’am gave us an
assignment. My topic was File Handling. I thought of combining a movie and
the subject, so my presentation became an amalgamation of the Ghajini film
and file handling.

I also made notes for Basic Electrical Engineering (BEE). I literally
enjoyed doing it. It helped me during exams.

Along with BEE, I also made notes for Computer Science. I typed everything
from top to bottom. It enhanced my aesthetic skills.

I also made tutorials during my 1st semester. They helped many students.
They also helped me during examinations through active learning.

    <h2><i>Karma Calling</i></h2>
    <p>
      <p>
"Karma Calling" implies that one's past actions (karma) are catching up
with them—the inevitable return of consequences for previous deeds. We had
an assignment in our English lab to make a PowerPoint presentation. I made
a PPT expressing my views on karma. Everyone praised me, and my English
ma’am asked my age. When I said I am 19 years old, she said I was too young
to understand karma, and she also mentioned that when she was 19, she didn’t
bother about all this.

    <h1><i>Exam timeee...</i></h1>
    <p>
      <p>
I prepared deeply for exams, and even at the last minute, I used to clarify
my peers’ queries. I really enjoyed the exam preparation time.
